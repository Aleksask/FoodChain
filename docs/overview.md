# FoodChain Overview

  * Find other nearby farmers producing same produce for similar delivery date.
  * Find nearby buyer for truck load of produce.
  
# Forces

  ## Farmers
  
  The farmer needs to sell at or around a certain date.
  By co-operating they should get a better price.
  By being a trustworthy supplier he is more likely to get a second, third contract.
  Farmer builds up credit worthiness to allow raising capital to invest in farm.
  
  ## Government
  
  An auditable supply chain allows potential taxation of farmers/client.
  (Farmer would make larger profits so should still be net positive.)
  (Client cuts out middleman so buys goods cheaper)
  
  ## Buyers
  
  If a buyer can buy direct from the grower they get a better price.
  Builds up as a trustworthy contract payer leading to cheaper prices / more stable partnerships with Co-ops.
  
# Challenges
